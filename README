DEVELOPER NOTE

This project is incomplete! This project is not expected to release until the
end of 2016, where it will then be officially released on the FNA website and
the FNA-XNA GitHub organization. Unless you plan on porting an XBLA game and
plan on doing it without any hacks, this repo is not for you!
